# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensured that my code was functional and secure by making sure there was no syntax errors or warnings that would interfere with my program and fix these errors and warning accordingly. Additionally, code coverage is a useful indicator of the general effectiveness of my JUnit tests. It informs me of the percentage of my code that my tests have covered. If my tests cover a large portion of my code, they are effectively testing it. This is indicated by a high code coverage. If I have low code coverage, it suggests that my tests are not adequately testing my code and are not testing as much of it as they should be.
 
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Requirements gathering is an essential step of designing software to ensure that a user's needs are incorporated into a program. There are various stages regarding gathering requirements, and they are all very important. I can interpret user needs by outlining the expectations of the system and how its users will interact with it.

# How do I approach designing software?
I try to take an iterative approach when designing software. I think it is efficient to break down the software into smaller chunks and cycles of designing, developing and tested.
